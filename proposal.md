# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
#The seas of freedom. if I have less time because of work, I'll change it to Spaceship and survival.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

#A game that lets you experience slice of life and hope. The game will be most focusing on you looking at the story and explore open world. there is challenges of questions there connecting to math problems.
#the other game lets you fight maany aliens but, fighting the alien won't make it hard. The trap they set are. As you reach specific score, the trap become harder to see, and the speed of the alien becomes faster. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
'''
"seas of freedom"execute renpy, first animation video. After video clip initialize, dialogue started on day 1. After dialogue, player now can explore the open world by switching from renpy to pygame. But, they can't explore yet until they finish all story. so, the player go to a building in pygame as the story goes. if they want to go to other building, there is no option for them to go into that building. After all story is done, they could do whatever they want. 
as for "spaceship and survival", as the program is executed; the player can now play the game. the game is common. many people play these games in their phone. The only differences are, this game don't give specific level and hardness and that specific level. my game will never be done until the player dies or maybe until the player gets bored until they actually kills themself in the game. As the player kills all alien, a new alien will come with a random ability and their total will also be random between 1-3, as the score gets higher than the specific score I set; it continues from 3-6. The trap will also be there as the player receive specific score. At first, the trap is with hint direction, and slow. But it gets faster as the score gets higher, and the alien laser and aim becomes more accurate no matter where you go. As The player isn't dead yet, the background will change color maybe i'll do that. that way it could give the player a hint that the field will slow their movement down making a very low chance of survival in the game.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

#TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

#TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
'''
what would I do less in the seas of freedom is, one focus story and not focusing on many other building in py game first, then I'll make the open world smaller. The only building I'll add is only connected to the story. And player can't customize the main character looks yet. I'll not input the skip buton in renpy so that the player will have to read the story no matter what unless they kept clicking the screen since their bored. I'll be focusing in the story mostly and the open world last. since, the point I'm making the game is the story. After story, then animation video, then I'll make the open world with pygame.''' 

As for the spaceship and survival, I'll not make the token gain and store option yet. The total aliens will be maximum 6 of them. they will not come from 360 degrees everywhere but from the top screen. but, They will move left right faster as you reach specific score making it challenging for you to aim at them since your laser is slower than their movement. Let's not forget about the trap that the alien had for you hardening the challenge further.

'''
I wish that I have time to make 3D graphics and learn them but I know I don't have enough time to achieve it knowing how hard it is to achieve and I don't even have the knowledge to make one. so, I'll be only focussing on 2d world like the old game. the best outcome is the customization for the main character body, shape, gender(but that would mean I have to make a big change to separate two gender in the story), players plane abilty and customization to help them battle the enemy and survive thir trap(haven't think of any unique ability yet).
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

3D graphics. I want the player to enjoy the game as living in the real dimension where they can really experience happiness and sadness in the game. And as for spaceship and survival, I also want 3D graphics to enter the world where player will experience real challenges since trap and obstacles will come from anywhere especially they can't see them and had to predict where is the trap as they reach a very high score.
